# GTP Window Food Reviewing System
An endogenous food reviewing system for the GTP Team. This project will have the ability to place items on the *window ledge* and allow other team members to review the food. I think this will make a great product as it will enhance more people to contribute to the window ledge. This will also contain a sort of *winner of the month* for best contribution. Do not be afraid to give this project a star and a watch!
